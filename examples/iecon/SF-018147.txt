In-memory-computing is an emerging approach thataims to shift computational load away from CPUs. It does so bytaking over simple calculations that can be performed in memory.Apart from improving performance for these operations, this alsoresults in a lower energy consumption, effectively rendering thistechnique very suitable for embedded systems.Due to being variable as well as non-volatile resistors, mem-ristors are capable of storing analog values. This renders themparticularly useful for in-memory computing.This paper presents a prototypical implementation of analogcalculations (addition, subtraction and multiplication), includinga way of representing the value zero. The prototype shownis based on an ESP32 microcontroller and typical calculationscurrently take around 1Î¼s.
