A high-frequency switching, multi-phase buckconverter capable of nanosecond-scale Dynamic VoltageScaling (DVS) is reported in this work. The proposed con-verter employs a time-domain compensator using VCOsand Voltage Controlled Delay Lines (VCDL). The closedloop bandwidth of the converter is scaled with the activenumber of phases by adjusting the control parametersin the compensator. In addition, this paper also pro-poses a digital-intensive adaptive dead-time controller thathelps to minimize unwanted body diode conduction/shortcircuit losses occurring in the power switches. A testchip fabricated in 55nm CMOS technology generates anoutput voltage of 0.6-1.2V from a 1.8V supply. A thin-film magnetic inductor with an inductance of 38nH and aquality factor of 14 along with a 10nF capacitor, filters theswitching pulses at the output. Proposed design achieves apeak efficiency of 86% and delivers an output power up to1.8W. This work is able to produce higher output currentup to 1.5A and a larger output slew-rate of>4VÎ¼/s thanthe state-of-the-art while switching at only 50MHz.
