A method and architecture are presented whichtolerates both permanent processor failures and permanentsoftware failures by scheduling a primary and a separatebackup on different processors for every real-time process,while further increasing system robustness and reliability, byusing primary and backup latest start times to effectively handleprimary and backup underruns and overruns,both before,and after, a permanent processor failure, which significantlyincreases the chances that a primary or backup may meet itsdeadline despite permanent hardware failures and permanentsoftware failures, and despite overrunning, while also satisfyingadditional complex constraints defined on the primaries andbackups such as precedence and exclusion relations, in a faulttolerant real-time embedded system.
