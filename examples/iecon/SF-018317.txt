A timer and interrupt management infrastructure isessential for a computer system executing a preemptive operatingsystem. This holds for single- and also for multicore systems.When it comes to OS-capable ISA-heterogeneous multicoresystems (systems that include cores of different ISAs, which allare capable of executing an operating system) the different timerand interrupt infrastructures of the different system ISAs arestill applicable. However, if reconfigurability is added on top ofthe ISA heterogeneity, meaning that the composition (number ofindividual cores) is runtime adaptable, the timer and interruptmanagement infrastructure needs to be reconsidered. In thispaper, a unified timer and interrupt management scheme isdeduced for a runtime adaptable, OS-capable, ISA-heterogeneousmulti-core system, consisting of ARM and RISC-V cores, that arecapable of executing Linux. This is done by analyzing/surveyingthe timer and interrupt management schemes of RISC-V andARM systems. Finally this paper will show that RISC-V timerand interrupt management devices are suitable to also managetimers and interrupts for ARM based systems.
