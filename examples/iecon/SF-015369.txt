This paper exploits circuit techniques to realize a power-gated MRAM with the instant-on characteristic. Each block in a large-capacity MRAM is gated by a separate power transistor, allowing it to be fully turned on after only 1.3 ns. As a result, the whole MRAM is always in sleep mode, except the selected block. This eliminates the need for access pattern prediction as well as the requirement that the MRAM must be in idle for a significant of time before it is put in sleep or deep sleep mode. Our simulation shows that even in the worst-case-scenario, 86% of leakage current is saved. In typical cases, there are 96.5% leakage and 69% total power reduction. Our proposed schemeâ€™s implementation is straight forward and incurs less than 0.5% area overhead, including power transistors and control circuits.
