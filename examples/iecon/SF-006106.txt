This work presents a silicon integrated high-performance thin-film inductor technology with improvedmagnetic core laminations. The deposition process pa-rameters of the lamination material are tuned to obtaingood quality lamination oxide, and its quality is veri-fied by analyzing elemental composition through energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. Due to the high-quality lamination oxide, a peak quality factor of 21 andinductance to DC resistance (L/RDC) ratio of 425 nH/Ohmare achieved in this inductor technology. These figureof merits represent more than 95% inductor switchingefficiency in power converters, and significant improve-ments in quality factor (Q) andL/RDCcompared to otherleading technologies.
