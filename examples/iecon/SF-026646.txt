The paper aims at proposing a non-invasive method for monitoring of the quality determining factors of Indian mangoes. The framework shows an IoT architecture in global mango cold chain using edge computing. Positioned at the inside of the reefer container, the system performs the task of sampling physio-chemical data from its integrated sensors and records the dynamic changes in continuous data streams. These records are treated in batches and incase of sensor events, the device triggers an alarm to a remote administration system hosted in Google cloud. GSM (during land transport) and on board Wi-Fi (during sea transport) are used as communication protocols during the phases of the journey. The data generated from the devices have been calibrated with reference to a standard Industry grade meter and compared with other similar systems.
